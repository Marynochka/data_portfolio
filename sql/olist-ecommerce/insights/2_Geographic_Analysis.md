# 📦 Geographic Analysis – Regional Delivery Performance  
Dataset: Olist Brazilian E-commerce

---

## Objective

Evaluate how delivery performance varies across Brazilian states and identify geographic regions that systematically underperform compared to the national benchmark.

This analysis answers:

5. Which customer states have the highest late delivery rates?  
6. What is the average delivery time by customer state?  
7. Which regions consistently underperform compared to the national average?

# 5️⃣ States with the Highest Late Delivery Rates

## Key Findings

| State | Late Delivery Rate | Total Orders |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| AL | 23.9% | 397 |
| MA | 19.7% | 717 |
| PI | 16.0% | 476 |
| CE | 15.3% | 1,279 |
| SE | 15.2% | 335 |
| BA | 14.0% | 3,256 |
| **RJ** | **13.5%** | **12,350** |

While AL has the highest percentage, **Rio de Janeiro (RJ)** stands out due to scale.

## 🚨 Rio de Janeiro – High Volume, High Impact Risk

RJ represents:

- 12,350 delivered orders  
- 13.5% late delivery rate  

Even though its late rate is lower than AL or MA, the absolute impact is much larger.

Approximate late orders in RJ:

> 12,350 × 13.5% ≈ **1,667 late deliveries**

This makes RJ one of the most operationally significant states.

### Why RJ Matters More Than Smaller States

- Small states may show high percentages but low absolute impact.
- RJ combines:
  - High order volume
  - Above-average late rate

Improving RJ’s late rate by even 2 percentage points would reduce hundreds of late deliveries.

This is where operational optimisation produces measurable business impact.

# 6️⃣ Average Delivery Time by Customer State

## National Benchmark

National average delivery time ≈ **12.5 days**

Delivery time ranges from:

- 8.7 days (SP)
- 29.3 days (RR)

A difference of over 20 days.

Northern states show the longest delivery durations, likely due to geographic and infrastructure constraints.

# 7️⃣ Regions Underperforming vs National Average

Two underperformance patterns emerge:

### 1️⃣ Structural Delay – North Region
Very long delivery times, large deviation from national average.

### 2️⃣ Reliability Risk – Northeast Region
Elevated late delivery rates combined with moderately high delivery times.

### 3️⃣ Scale-Driven Operational Risk – Rio de Janeiro

RJ differs from North/Northeast patterns:

- Delivery time is moderate (~15 days)
- Late rate is elevated
- Order volume is very high

This suggests:
- Operational strain at scale
- Carrier capacity limitations
- Potential bottlenecks in last-mile delivery

RJ is not the worst-performing state by percentage —  
but it may represent the largest absolute operational exposure.

# Executive Summary

Brazil shows clear geographic inequality in delivery performance.

- Northern states face structural infrastructure delays.
- Northeast states experience elevated reliability risk.
- Rio de Janeiro represents high-volume operational risk.
- São Paulo acts as an efficiency benchmark.

Strategic focus should balance:
1. Structural infrastructure challenges (North)
2. Forecasting and reliability calibration (Northeast)
3. High-volume optimisation opportunities (RJ)
