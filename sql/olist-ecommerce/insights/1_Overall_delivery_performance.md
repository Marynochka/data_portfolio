## 1️⃣ Overall Delivery Performance

### 1. Order Status Distribution

| Order Status | Orders | % of Total Orders |
|--------------|--------|-------------------|
| delivered    | 96,478 | 97.02%            |
| shipped      | 1,107  | 1.11%             |
| canceled     | 625    | 0.63%             |
| unavailable  | 609    | 0.61%             |
| invoiced     | 314    | 0.32%             |
| processing   | 301    | 0.30%             |
| created      | 5      | 0.01%             |
| approved     | 2      | 0.00%             |

**Insight:**  
Approximately **97% of all orders are successfully delivered**, indicating strong overall operational reliability. Non-delivered statuses account for a small fraction of total volume.

### 2. Late Delivery Rate

**8.12%** of delivered orders were delivered late.

**Interpretation:**  
While the majority of deliveries meet expectations, nearly 1 in 12 customers experience delays — a non-trivial share that may affect customer satisfaction.

---

### 3. Average Delay for Late Orders

The **average delay among late orders is 8.87 days**.

**Interpretation:**  
When delays occur, they are substantial. An average delay of nearly 9 days suggests operational bottlenecks rather than minor timing fluctuations.

---

### 4. Actual vs Estimated Delivery Time

- Average actual delivery time: **12.5 days**
- Average estimated delivery time: **24.37 days**
- Estimated delivery time exceeds actual delivery time by **11.88 days**

**Interpretation:**  
Delivery estimates are significantly conservative. While this reduces the probability of missed promises, it may negatively impact conversion rates if customers perceive delivery times as too long.

### 5. Monthly Late Delivery Trend

#### Key Findings

- Baseline late delivery rate during stable periods is **3–5%**.
- Major performance spikes observed:
  - **Nov 2017:** 14.31%
  - **Feb 2018:** 15.99%
  - **Mar 2018:** 21.36% (peak)
- March 2018 represents the worst operational month, with approximately **1 in 5 deliveries late**.
- Months with extremely low order volume were excluded from interpretation.

#### Interpretation

Delivery performance is generally stable but exhibits significant volatility during specific periods. Spikes align with high order volumes, suggesting operational stress during peak demand. The severe increase in early 2018 indicates a temporary disruption rather than a gradual decline in performance.

#### Business Implication

Sustained late delivery rates above 15–20% would materially impact customer experience and retention. These spike periods warrant further investigation into logistics capacity, warehouse constraints, or carrier performance during peak demand.
